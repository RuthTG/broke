# **_Budget Tracker_**
  
## **_Description_**
The Budget Tracker is, as the name suggests, a budget tracking application built with PWA capabilities

## **_Technologies Used_**  
* Express.js
* Mongoose
* NodeJS

## **_Installation_**
Note: users are expected to know some JavaScript

* Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) if you haven't done so yet.
* You should also have pulled this repository at this point (we'll get to Node in second)
* On your project directory, you will initialize npm by typing ```npm init```
* After that command runs a series of processes, you're ready to use npm.
* Type ```npm i``` on the root of the repo you've just pulled. This will fetch all dependencies used to get this app to work.
* At this point, the project is ready. Let's now run ```npm start``` on your terminal (make sure you're on the root directory where the 'server.js' file is located)
